# Codepen-Challenge-Shapes-Week-3-Blobs
A challenge on Codepen where the main shape of the pen has to be related to a blob. For this I just used plain CSS and HTML.

Just trying to get more experience in making CSS animations. For this project I made a basic lavalamp (like most people for this challenge). I am starting to get a good feel of basic CSS animations as well as making shapes with CSS. 

New things I am trying in this project:
-CSS hover function
-Javascript button
